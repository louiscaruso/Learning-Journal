# How Computers work
- input, store info, process, output


## Different parts
- Input
- Store
- Process
- Output



## Data and Binary
- Computers utilize ones and zeroes 
- Wires and circuits are used in a computer to pass around the binary to different parts
- One wire(bits) can be:
    - on or off
    - yes or no
    - true or false
    - 1 or 0
- More wires = more bits


### Binary number system
- Binary can count up to any number
- The more wires, the more numbers you can store
- Text, images, sounds can all be represented with numbers
- Binary can represent letters from the alphabet as on or off signals


## Circuits and Logic
- A simple circuit takes electric signal and flips it
- The signal that goes in is not the same as the signal that comes out, and so we call this circuit "not"
- Complicated circuits take multiple signals and combine them to give different results
- A circuit will only give "1" if the first signal and second signal are both "1"
- Adder circuits take two bits "1" or "2" and adds them together to calculate the sum
